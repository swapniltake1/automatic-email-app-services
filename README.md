Welcome to the backend repository of the Angular-Spring Boot email automation project! 📧

In this repository, you'll find the powerhouse behind the scenes – the Spring Boot backend that handles the heavy lifting of automating email sending. Seamlessly integrated with the Angular frontend, this backend ensures that your email automation process is smooth, reliable, and hassle-free.

🔥 Features:

Robust REST API: The Spring Boot REST API offers a robust foundation for managing email sending requests, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
Email Queueing: Emails are processed in a queue, guaranteeing that they're sent in the right order and minimizing any hiccups in the sending process.
